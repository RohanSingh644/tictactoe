tic-tac-toe game using html,css and javascript
<p>Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player strategy game that I have developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a user-friendly interface, responsive design, and intuitive gameplay mechanics. Players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, aiming to align three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal to win. The implementation leverages JavaScript for game logic, ensuring smooth interactions and real-time updates, while HTML and CSS provide a clean and engaging visual experience.</p>
